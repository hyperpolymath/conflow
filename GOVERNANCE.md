# Governance

This document describes the governance model for conflow.

## Project Structure

### Roles

#### Maintainers

Maintainers have full access to the repository and are responsible for:

- Reviewing and merging contributions
- Release management
- Security response
- Strategic direction
- Community health

Current maintainers are listed in [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md).

#### Contributors

Anyone who has had a contribution merged. Contributors are recognized in
release notes and `humans.txt`.

#### Community Members

Anyone who participates in issues, discussions, or uses the project.

## Decision Making

### Consensus-Based

We aim for consensus on all significant decisions:

1. **Proposal**: Open an issue describing the change
2. **Discussion**: Community feedback period (minimum 1 week for major changes)
3. **Decision**: Maintainers evaluate feedback and decide
4. **Documentation**: Decision is documented in the issue

### Lazy Consensus

For minor changes (typos, small fixes), maintainers may merge without
extended discussion. If anyone objects, the change can be reverted and
discussed.

### Voting

If consensus cannot be reached:

- Each maintainer gets one vote
- Simple majority wins
- Ties are broken by the lead maintainer
- Voting period: 1 week minimum

## Becoming a Maintainer

### Path to Maintainership

1. Sustained, high-quality contributions over 6+ months
2. Demonstrated understanding of project goals
3. Positive community interactions
4. Nomination by existing maintainer
5. Approval by majority of maintainers

### Maintainer Responsibilities

- Review contributions in a timely manner
- Participate in security response
- Uphold Code of Conduct
- Mentor new contributors
- Participate in governance decisions

### Stepping Down

Maintainers may step down at any time by notifying other maintainers.
Inactive maintainers (6+ months no activity) may be moved to emeritus status.

## Changes to Governance

This governance model can be amended by:

1. Opening an issue with proposed changes
2. Minimum 2-week discussion period
3. Approval by 2/3 of maintainers

## Conflict Resolution

### Technical Disputes

1. Discuss in issue/MR
2. Seek input from additional maintainers
3. If unresolved, maintainer vote

### Code of Conduct Violations

See [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for enforcement procedures.

### Governance Disputes

Escalate to full maintainer group for resolution.

## RSR Alignment

This governance model aligns with RSR principles:

- **Emotional Safety**: No-blame culture, safe to make mistakes
- **Community Over Ego**: Consensus-based decisions
- **Transparency**: All decisions documented publicly
- **Accountability**: Clear roles and responsibilities
